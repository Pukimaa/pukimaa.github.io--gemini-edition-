# quili

quili is an 2D Pixelgame made with the Game-Engine Godot.

The game is not published yet and is not in development anymore. But you can still download the Sourcecode on Github to make the game better because I will still accept pull requests. Also I want to get the game downloadable even in this early state. You can download this Game below.
